# Monkey Rush

## Overview
"Monkey Rush" is a 3D simulation of a monkey driving a car through a simulated city zooscape. This project is developed in C#, designed in Blender, and deployed using Unity. It aims to provide an interactive driving experience.

## Features
- **Simulated Cityscapes:** Every prop is meticulously crafted in Blender for an immersive environment.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Makes use of Unity's lighting system to reflect different times of day and weather conditions.
- **Car Physics:** Employs C# for precise car movement and collision detection.
- **C# scripting**: this has been used within Unity to handle game mechanics including car physics, character behaviors, environmental interactions, dynamic lighting, and core game logic, creating an interactive driving experience.

## Requirements
- Blender (for model creation and texturing)
- Unity (for deployment and physics engine)
- C# Compiler (for car logic and simulation code)

## Setup
1. **Blender Models:**
   - Open the `.blend` files in the `/Models` directory to view or modify the 3D models.

2. **C# Code:**
   - Navigate to the `/Code` directory to view or edit the C# source files.
   - Compile the code using your preferred C# compiler.

3. **Unity Project:**
   - Open the Unity project from the `/Unity` directory.
   - The compiled C# code is integrated into Unity through plugins.

## How to Use
- Run the Unity project.
- Use the arrow keys to control the car within the simulation.
- Interact with the environment to explore different weather modes.

## Development
- **3D Modelling:**
  - The models are created using Blender. Refer to the `/Models` directory for all Blender assets.

- **Simulation Logic:**
  - The car's logic and physics are implemented in C#. Source files can be found in `/Code`.

- **Unity Deployment:**
  - Unity is used to piece together the models and logic and handle the rendering. Scenes and assets are located in `/Unity`.
